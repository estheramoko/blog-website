    <h1>About Adoyo</h1>
    <p> Hey, you! since you have already come this far, im assuming you love poetry as much as i do. This has not always been the case for me, though. When i was much younger, I loved to write. As i got older, the fire may have died down a bit. One fine day during an English lesson, i realised that writing really is on outlet for me, considering how much i hate talking about how i feel. Why should i keep bottling up my emotions while i have a pen and paper? Also, i had been begging God to show me what my talent is. I gave my life to Christ( BEST CHOICE EVER!) and ive had a much easier time expressing myself generally. All this inspired me to help other people who may want to write or express themselves, especially if they struggle to do that verbally. I  understand fully how it feels to feel "alone" or "lonely" and suffering in silence is no fun for sure. Anyway, sixteen right now and in the process of discovering myself, and i would love to help those who want to do the same.</p>
